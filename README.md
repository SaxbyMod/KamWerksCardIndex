Scryfall bot but for Inscryption. Currently the bot can look up card in the following:

IMF Vanilla
IMF Competitive
IMF Eternal
IMF Mr.Egg
Inscryption Augmented
Inscryption Multiplayer: Redux
Custom TCG Inscryption
Desaft's Mod (CTI)

IF you have any request for new set send me a message on discord. `mouthless_stoat` The Maker of the Original Bot that this Bot is a modification of.

## How to host the bot yourself

If you are planning to host a similar bot head over to [MagpieTutor](https://github.com/Mouthless-Stoat/MagpieTutor/tree/master) theres a great explanation there.

## Todo List

- Make tokens appear in the sigil instead of the Extra Info section.
- Add Inscryption Overhaul, 5A, Dingz Megamix, A2 PvP.
- Rework the IMF to be in a similar style to the `Augmented`, `Custom TCG Inscryption` and `Desaft's Mod (CTI)` formats.
- Have the bot read directly from Notions pages instead of elking google sheets.

## Plan for next update
- Search all set modifier.
- The prior mentioned token system.
- Fetch random card from set for a deckbuilding challenge(?)
